It will pre-install a dev environment with all the big and small tools we use at [Web^ID](https://web-id.fr).

## What do I need to start?

A freshly installed (or not) macOS computer. Nothing else.

## Getting Started

After you clone this repository, you first need to `make dotfiles`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:web-id-fr/mario.git
cd mario
make dotfiles
```

This will copy the `config_vars.yml.dist` to `config_vars.yml` and the `mario-playbook.yml.dist` to `mario-playbook.yml`. You should edit those accordingly, see [Configuration](#configuration).

Then you just have to:

```
make install
```

### But what kind of magic is this? üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Calling `make install` will:

- [x] Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if needed.
- [x] Install [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) if needed.
- [x] Run the `mario-playbook.yml` ansible playbook.

*Tip: if you only need to run the playbook, you can just `make mario`.*

## Configuration

## Old README bellow üëá

This is my Mac OS setup with Ansible

Edit `config_vars.yml` file accordingly.

```ssh
make install
```

Resetting this repository's origin to be able to push

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:tentacode/blacksmithery.git
```

## Bonus

On a fresh install, remove all the Dock items in one command :

```bash
defaults delete com.apple.dock persistent-apps; killall Dock
```

Hide all files in the desktop :

```bash
defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false; killall Finder
```
